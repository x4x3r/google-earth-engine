Google Earth Engine Data Extraction

This project demonstrates data extraction using the Google Earth Engine API based on shape file (shp) contours lines. The shape files are in nyu_2451_44247.zip and the extracted files are in Landsat_image_download.tif and Sentinel_image_download.tif. This is part of a bigger project for large-scale satellite image data extraction.
